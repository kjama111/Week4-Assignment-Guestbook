ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?

- i made a form with functioning submit buttons but could not transfer answers onto a table after submission
- I successfullly deployed my server and client on render
- I made 2 tables on supabase using sql
- i created a GET and a POST API I think....?

3. ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

- I made a table of dummy data on the html i was unable to transfer from the SQL/Supbase straight onto html (i dont even know if that was what we were supponsed to do)
- im not condfident with media queries therefore was not happy with how the html looks on mobile screen

  ðŸŽ¯ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

  - i didnt understand the purpose of SQL/Supabase as i was unable to transfer data from server to html website in which a user would be able to see
